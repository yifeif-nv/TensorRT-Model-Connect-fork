## 💻 Example Code

```bash
trtmc build Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B -o qwen3-0.6b.bundle
trtmc run ./qwen3-0.6b.bundle --prompt "What is the capital of France? Answer in one word." --chat-template --no-thinking
# Generated text: Paris
```

The same bundle works from
[C++](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Connect/api/cpp-api):

```cpp
auto pipeline = trtmc::load("./qwen3-0.6b.bundle");
std::cout << pipeline->generate("What is the capital of France? Answer in one word.").text << '\n';
```

For an application-level example, see the local
[Evidence Workbench](examples/evidence_workbench/README.md), which combines
Model Connect OCR with content-addressed document snapshots, page-level
citations, deterministic chronology, and reviewable audit exports.

## 🔎 What is TensorRT-Model-Connect?
**TensorRT Model Connect is an extensive collection of AI Model reference implementations in C++, on top of NVIDIA TensorRT**. Model Connect is powered by an agentic workflow that continuously adds support for upcoming models, drastically reducing integration effort on user side and time until new models become compatible.

## 🧭 Choose the right abstraction layer

- Use TensorRT-Model-Connect to explore models quickly and evaluate broad
  model coverage.
- For production LLM/VLM deployment on NVIDIA edge platforms where performance
  is the priority, start directly with
  [TensorRT Edge-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM).

## 💡 Why TensorRT-Model-Connect?

- Start from a supported Hugging Face or local checkpoint and build TensorRT
  engines without an intermediate ONNX export step.
- Hand a versioned `.bundle` artifact from the Python-first build environment
  to native C++ task APIs such as text generation, transcription, image and
  video generation, segmentation, embedding, and forecasting.
- Use model-family-owned builders, runtime pipelines, helper kernels, and
  validation contracts as concrete blueprints for modification and
  customization.
- Keep native TensorRT execution and exactly qualified optimized-runtime
  dispatch behind the same task-oriented application boundary.

Read the [Project Overview](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Connect/getting-started/project-overview)
for the architecture boundary, intended users, and comparison with other
TensorRT integration paths.

TensorRT-Model-Connect is a reference implementation. Users are responsible
for trusting the checkpoints, bundles, native libraries, and local environment
they provide when building or running models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Recommended Quick Start: AI-Native**

Give an AI coding agent with terminal, Docker, and NVIDIA GPU access this
prompt:

```text
/goal Use the current TensorRT-Model-Connect checkout, or clone
https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Connect.git if none is provided. Read
AGENTS.md, then follow website/docs/getting-started/source-build.md and
website/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md exactly. Do not modify source,
tests, Dockerfiles, git history, or remote state. Report the selected GPU,
exact commands, bundle path, inference output, and any deviation from the
documentation.
```

[Quick Start documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-Model-Connect/getting-started/quick-start).
